Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of combining 
"the variables and the functions" together.

->  We can achieve Encapsulation by creating a class.
->  A class holds the variables and functions together.
->  Data Hiding can be achieved by implementing Encapsulation.



Data Hiding
-----------
Data Hiding is the process of protecting 
the elements of a class from unintended changes.

->  Data hiding is implemented using access modifier.
