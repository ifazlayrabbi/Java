Abstraction is the process of 
hiding the implementation details
and showing the necessary parts - to the user.


Abstraction is 2 types:

1) Abstract class
2) Interface class



Properties of Abstract class
------------------------------------
*  One class can inherit only one class 
   (which can be either abstract class or common class).
*  Abstract class is extended. (extends)

1) Abstract class is declared with an abstract keyword.
2) Abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods.
3) It can have constructors.
4) "Object" can not be created, (because, it is abstract).
5) When derived class's object is created,
   first, base class's constructor is called,
   second, derived class's constructor is called.
   (Constructor chaining.)
6) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables.

7) To declare "abstract function", we need "abstract class".
8) "abstract class" may or may not contain "abstract function"
   but the reason of creating "abstract class" is to declare "abstract function".
9) "abstract function" doesn't have a body.
10) If a class inherits "abstract class" which contains "abstract function",
   then the derived class must to define the "abstract function".
