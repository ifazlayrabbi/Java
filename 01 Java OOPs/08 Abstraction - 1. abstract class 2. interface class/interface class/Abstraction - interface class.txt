Abstraction is the process of 
hiding the implementation details
and showing the necessary parts - to the user.


Abstraction is 2 types:

1) Abstract class
2) Interface class



Properties of Interface class
------------------------------------
*  One class can inherit multiple "interface class".
*  interface class is implemented. (implements)

1) No constructor. No object.

2) Functions are by default "public and abstract".
   Thatâ€™s why interface is also known as a pure (100%) abstract class.

3) Variables are by default "public, static and final".

4) Derived classes must define all of the Interface class's functons.

5) Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
   - One class can inherit multiple "interface class".
